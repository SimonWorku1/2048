Summary: This is our simple version of the original 2048 game for our CMSI 1010 final project. The code was developed using python and pygame.

How to play: After opening the game through main.py, press any key to start playing.
Combine tiles by using WASD or the arrow keys to slide the tiles across the 4x4 grid. Tiles will combine when two tiles of the same value are moved into each other. After every move, a new random tile will spawn on the grid. The game is won when a tile with the value of 2048 is created, and you lose when the there are no more valid moves.
